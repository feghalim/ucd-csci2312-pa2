## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 2

### WHEN GRADING

On the canvas page for PA2, the program states that only the Point.cpp and Cluster.cpp files will be tested. Due to an issue on my machine I had to declare most of the overloaded operator functions in the header files for the functions. Please when grading use my provided Point.h and Cluster.h files.

**FUNCTIONALITY**

Program currently runs but some functions will not finish running presumably due to an issue with CMake on my machine. I have tried manually debugging the program and all functions work correctly
